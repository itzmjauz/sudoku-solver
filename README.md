Sudoku-solver
========================
This repo contains simple/na√Øve sudo solvers in a couple of languages.
I write these when I'm bored, attempting a new language, or attempting a new method.

sudoku-solver.c
------------------------
This one was the original idea, just a tiny project, it can be compiled using make:
```
make
``` 
And cleaned up :
```
make clean
```

sudoku-solver.java
------------------------
This one is unfinished, I should probably remove it. 

rust
------------------------
The rust port is still a work in progress.
But it can be run using 
```
cargo build
``` 
You can also compile it manually, but why would you.
```
cd src
rustc main.rs
./main
```
